# VIMRC

## Description
This is my personal vimrc that I use for my day to day job . I'm an hardware engineer, so I use mostly HDL (VHDL, Verilog, System Verilog), C/C++ and Python for scripting. 
I've decided to share it on github for no reason other than the fact that I've put a little too much effort into this.

# Features
- [plug.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug "plug.vim") as plugin manager
- High emphasis on HDL development
- C/C++
- Python
- Kinda work on windows :tw-1f615:

## Why should I use this?
You shouldn't. 

## How do I start?
I have made to install scripts, nstall.shnux and nstall.bat ndows, to quickly deploy the configuration and download plug.vim on a new system.
